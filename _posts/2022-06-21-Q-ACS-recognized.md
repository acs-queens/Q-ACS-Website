The American Chemical Society (ACS), one of the world’s largest scientific organizations, boasts over 150,000 members globally. In the U.S., it's represented by 185 local chapters, facilitating connections among chemists and chemical engineers. The organization extends its reach to over 140 countries, with India hosting the most international student chapters.

Recently, Queen’s University in Canada established its ACS student chapter, thanks to funding totalling CAD 1,000, comprising a grant and donations. To gain official recognition, the Chapter needed a minimum of six members with ACS memberships, which was achieved and certified in May 2022. Thanks are owed (Ordered alphabetically by surname) to: 1) Joshua (Josh) Innis 2) Julia McPhail 3) Daisy Nebel 4) Alessia Rizzello and 5) Max Van Zyl. Josh, Julia, Daisy, and Alessia, all of whom are/were Departmental Student Council (DSC) members, were able to utilize the Department’s Student Recognition reimbursement to fund their ACS memberships, while Dr. Farnaz Heidar-Zadeh generously covered her summer research student Max’s membership.

The Chapter's focus is on fostering community and providing members with valuable opportunities. For instance, one member recently secured a spot in the prestigious ACS Postdoc-to-Faculty Workshop. Looking ahead, the Chapter aspires to achieve accolades such as the Alma Mater Society’s “New Club of the Year” award and recognition as an ACS “Green Chemistry Student Chapter.” However, member involvement remains integral to accomplishing these goals.
