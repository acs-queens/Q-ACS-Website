On June 28, 2022, Q-ACS celebrated the 95th anniversary of the ACS Women Chemists Committee (WCC). Q-ACS was awarded the largest possible grant offered by WCC to host an event. The grant stipulated that the event “must follow the WCC mission to ‘attract, retain, develop, promote, and advocate for women to positively impact diversity, equity, and inclusion in the [American Chemical] Society and the profession” and that “[t]he event must have at least 10 participants.” Q-ACS worked with other groups including the Department of Chemical Engineering, Gender Minorities in Physics (GEMINI-P), and QC-IDEAS to promote the event. The event featured talks by 1) Dr. Amy Balija (ACS National WCC Chair) (Virtual) 2) Dr. Amanda Bongers (Queen’s Chemistry Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee Chair) 3) Dr. Shoma Sinha (Queen’s Women’s Network and Queen’s Partnerships and Innovation) 4) Brooke Ring (Women in Science at Queen’s) and 5) Rachel Shum (Chemical Institute of Canada – Kingston Section). Q-ACS provided refreshments, and the event was nicely attended.
