On March 30, 2023, Q-ACS hosted its largest event of 2022-2023: the chapter’s inaugural spring reception *Celebrating Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Indigeneity (EDII) in the Chemical Sciences*. This event was open to the entire department, ranging from undergraduate students to faculty and staff. The goal was to organize a barrier-free and safe environment for the Queen’s chemistry community to network and discuss EDII. To make this event accessible and free-of-charge, the chapter secured ~$10,000 CAD of funding from several sources, including ACS, NanoFabrication Kingston, Public Service Alliance of Canada – 901, Dupont Kingston Technology Centre, and Queen’s University. 

The event was attended by ~100 people and included a formal reception and dinner in the Limestone City Ballroom at the Four Points by Sheraton Kingston. After the social hour, the attendees heard from chapter representatives and three keynote speakers: Dr. Racquel Jemison [Program Manager, ACS Office of Diversity (Video)]; Dr. Nicholas (Nick) Mosey [Associate Dean (Research) and Deputy Provost (Academic Operations and Inclusion), Queen’s University – Faculty of Arts and Science]; and Dr. Elliot Chapple [Director (EDII), Queen’s University – Faculty of Arts and Science]. The event concluded with an award ceremony honouring members of the Queen’s chemistry community through the *Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Scholars Recognition Program and Chapter Excellence awards*.
