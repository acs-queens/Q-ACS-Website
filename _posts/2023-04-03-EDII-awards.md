Q-ACS held two recognition programs to honor Queen’s community leaders in the chemical sciences and recognized the awardees with commemorating certificates during the Chapter’s spring reception.

The "Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Scholars Recognition Program" was established to promote talented graduate students and postdoctoral scholars demonstrating leadership in mentoring, promotion of DEIR, and promotion of research safety. Q-ACS collected nominations within the department and, as a result, ACS recognized six Queen’s members (one graduate student and one postdoctoral scholar in each category).

In addition, Q-ACS instituted the “Excellence Awards Program”, modelled on the ACS Salutes to Excellence program, to underscore outstanding accomplishments or achievements of service by external partners who have made a positive impact on everyday life or who have helped contribute to greater public awareness of chemistry. Q-ACS awarded:
1.	Excellence in EDII to QC-IDEAS (received by Ayden Harrison)
2.	Initiatives Excellence to Department of Chemistry’s “Hand Sanitizer Project” during the COVID-19 pandemic (received by Dr. Richard Oleschuk)
3.	Alumni Excellence to Dr. Alex Veinot.
