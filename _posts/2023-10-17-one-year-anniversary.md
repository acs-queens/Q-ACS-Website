The Q-ACS Chapter is one year old! The Chapter, initiated and lead by an amazing group of (inter)national (under)graduate students, has contributed to the vitality of the department in many ways. The Chapter’s mission is to 1) promote current and former students, staff, faculty, and the department as a whole, 2) organize professional development events for students and postdocs, 3) establish travel awards and outreach activates, and 4) facilitate diversity, equity, inclusion, and respect (DEIR). Securing over $15,000 of funding, the Chapter:

1.	Celebrated 95th anniversary of the ACS Women Chemists Committee (June 2022)
2.	Established ACS graduate student and postdoctoral scholars’ recognition program (July 2022)
3.	Presented Q-ACS Chapter Excellence Awards in two categories: Excellence in EDII and Initiatives Excellence (March 2023)
4.	Organized professional and technical development workshop series (December 2022; May & June 2023)
5.	Offered its first “Professional Development Travel Award” to support 3 chemistry students to attend “Women Creating a More Sustainable World” in Ottawa (March 2023)
6.	Hosted its inaugural Spring reception entitled “Celebrating EDII in the Chemical Sciences” (March 2023)
7.	Organized viewing of the live ACS Webinar by Nobel Laureate Carolyn Bertozzi in partnership with QGCS (June 2023)
   
These events have been facilitated by a dedicated group of current and former members including Daniel Reddy, Jess Deng, Julia McPhail, Madison Langley, Malek Hassan, Mark McKeown, and Maximilian van Zyl. The Chapter acknowledges funding from ACS, DuPont Kingston Technology Centre, NanoFabrication Kingston, Public Service Alliance of Canada – 901, and Carbon to Metal Coating Institute, and Queen’s University. The Chapter thanks the department for their continued support and guidance.
