<p>The Q-ACS Chapter is one year old! The Chapter, initiated and lead by an amazing group of (inter)national (under)graduate students, has contributed to the vitality of the department in many ways. The Chapter’s mission is to 1) promote current and former students, staff, faculty, and the department as a whole, 2) organize professional development events for students and postdocs, 3) establish travel awards and outreach activates, and 4) facilitate diversity, equity, inclusion, and respect (DEIR). Securing over $15,000 of funding, the Chapter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Celebrated 95th anniversary of the ACS Women Chemists Committee (June 2022)</li>
  <li>Established ACS graduate student and postdoctoral scholars’ recognition program (July 2022)</li>
  <li>Presented Q-ACS Chapter Excellence Awards in two categories: Excellence in EDII and Initiatives Excellence (March 2023)</li>
  <li>Organized professional and technical development workshop series (December 2022; May &amp; June 2023)</li>
  <li>Offered its first “Professional Development Travel Award” to support 3 chemistry students to attend “Women Creating a More Sustainable World” in Ottawa (March 2023)</li>

<p>Q-ACS is dedicated to nurturing the academic and professional growth of the department. This year, the chapter launched a series of three enriching workshops, along with the introduction of a Professional Development Travel Award, aimed at providing students and postdoctoral scholars with essential skills and opportunities.</p>

<p>1. Data Analysis Overview by Dr. Randy Ellis</p>

<p>Kicking off its professional development series, Q-ACS welcomed Dr. Randy Ellis from Queen’s University’s School of Computing and Department of Surgery to lead an enriching “Data Analysis Overview” workshop. This session was tailored to the unique needs of chemistry students and professionals, focusing on data analysis techniques directly applicable to their field.</p>

<p>2. Presentation Skills by ACS Fellow Dr. Mark Jones</p>

<p>Communication is paramount in any profession. Dr. Mark Jones, an ACS Fellow and renowned expert, conducted the “Presentation Skills” workshop, teaching the art of delivering compelling presentations and captivating audiences. These skills not only enhance professional growth but also enable members to effectively share their research.</p>

<p>3. Career Kick-Starter: Preparing for a Successful Career by ACS Fellow Dr. Ajay Mallia (in collaboration with Science-to-Business Network - Kingston Chapter)</p>

<p>The “Career Kick-Starter” workshop, led by ACS Fellow, Dr. Ajay Mallia, addressed the challenges of transitioning from graduate school to a successful career. Attendees gained insights into resume building, job searching strategies, and interview preparation, boosting their confidence to navigate the professional world.</p>

<p>In addition to these workshops, Q-ACS introduced its inaugural Professional Development Travel Award. This initiative reflects the chapter’s commitment to supporting members’ growth and career aspirations. Three chemistry students were granted the opportunity to attend the “Women Creating a More Sustainable World Conference” in Ottawa. This experience not only exposed the attendees to cutting-edge research and networking but also aligned with the chapter’s values of sustainability and inclusivity.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Q-ACS is helping to foster the next generation of chemistry leaders. Through these workshops and the Professional Development Travel Award, the chapter empowers its members with essential skills, knowledge, and valuable opportunities. As the Chapter continues to invest in its members’ growth, Q-ACS hopes to serve as a strong support system in the Queen’s chemical community.</p>

<p>Q-ACS held two recognition programs to honor Queen’s community leaders in the chemical sciences and recognized the awardees with commemorating certificates during the Chapter’s spring reception.</p>

<p>The “Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Scholars Recognition Program” was established to promote talented graduate students and postdoctoral scholars demonstrating leadership in mentoring, promotion of DEIR, and promotion of research safety. Q-ACS collected nominations within the department and, as a result, ACS recognized six Queen’s members (one graduate student and one postdoctoral scholar in each category).</p>

<p>On March 30, 2023, Q-ACS hosted its largest event of 2022-2023: the chapter’s inaugural spring reception <em>Celebrating Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Indigeneity (EDII) in the Chemical Sciences</em>. This event was open to the entire department, ranging from undergraduate students to faculty and staff. The goal was to organize a barrier-free and safe environment for the Queen’s chemistry community to network and discuss EDII. To make this event accessible and free-of-charge, the chapter secured ~$10,000 CAD of funding from several sources, including ACS, NanoFabrication Kingston, Public Service Alliance of Canada – 901, Dupont Kingston Technology Centre, and Queen’s University.</p>

<p>The event was attended by ~100 people and included a formal reception and dinner in the Limestone City Ballroom at the Four Points by Sheraton Kingston. After the social hour, the attendees heard from chapter representatives and three keynote speakers: Dr. Racquel Jemison [Program Manager, ACS Office of Diversity (Video)]; Dr. Nicholas (Nick) Mosey [Associate Dean (Research) and Deputy Provost (Academic Operations and Inclusion), Queen’s University – Faculty of Arts and Science]; and Dr. Elliot Chapple [Director (EDII), Queen’s University – Faculty of Arts and Science]. The event concluded with an award ceremony honouring members of the Queen’s chemistry community through the <em>Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Scholars Recognition Program and Chapter Excellence awards</em>.</p>

<p>On June 28, 2022, Q-ACS celebrated the 95th anniversary of the ACS Women Chemists Committee (WCC). Q-ACS was awarded the largest possible grant offered by WCC to host an event. The grant stipulated that the event “must follow the WCC mission to ‘attract, retain, develop, promote, and advocate for women to positively impact diversity, equity, and inclusion in the [American Chemical] Society and the profession” and that “[t]he event must have at least 10 participants.” Q-ACS worked with other groups including the Department of Chemical Engineering, Gender Minorities in Physics (GEMINI-P), and QC-IDEAS to promote the event. The event featured talks by 1) Dr. Amy Balija (ACS National WCC Chair) (Virtual) 2) Dr. Amanda Bongers (Queen’s Chemistry Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee Chair) 3) Dr. Shoma Sinha (Queen’s Women’s Network and Queen’s Partnerships and Innovation) 4) Brooke Ring (Women in Science at Queen’s) and 5) Rachel Shum (Chemical Institute of Canada – Kingston Section). Q-ACS provided refreshments, and the event was nicely attended.</p>

<p><em>This blog post is an abridged version of <a href="https://www.chem.queensu.ca/e-pluribus-unum-queens-university-student-chapter-american-chemical-society-acs">an article I wrote for the Department of Chemistry’s website</a></em></p>

<p>The American Chemical Society (ACS), one of the world’s largest scientific organizations, boasts over 150,000 members globally. In the U.S., it’s represented by 185 local chapters, facilitating connections among chemists and chemical engineers. The organization extends its reach to over 140 countries, with India hosting the most international student chapters.</p>

<p>Recently, Queen’s University in Canada established its ACS student chapter, thanks to funding totalling CAD 1,000, comprising a grant and donations. To gain official recognition, the Chapter needed a minimum of six members with ACS memberships, which was achieved and certified in May 2022. Thanks are owed (Ordered alphabetically by surname) to: 1) Joshua (Josh) Innis 2) Julia McPhail 3) Daisy Nebel 4) Alessia Rizzello and 5) Max Van Zyl. Josh, Julia, Daisy, and Alessia, all of whom are/were Departmental Student Council (DSC) members, were able to utilize the Department’s Student Recognition reimbursement to fund their ACS memberships, while Dr. Farnaz Heidar-Zadeh generously covered her summer research student Max’s membership.</p>

<p>The Chapter’s focus is on fostering community and providing members with valuable opportunities. For instance, one member recently secured a spot in the prestigious ACS Postdoc-to-Faculty Workshop. Looking ahead, the Chapter aspires to achieve accolades such as the Alma Mater Society’s “New Club of the Year” award and recognition as an ACS “Green Chemistry Student Chapter.” However, member involvement remains integral to accomplishing these goals.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daniel Reddy</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
