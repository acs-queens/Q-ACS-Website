# Queen's University International Student Chapter of the ACS (Q-ACS)

Q-ACS, initiated and led by a group of (inter)national (under)graduate students, contributes to the vitality of Queen's University's Department of Chemistry in many ways. The Chapterâ€™s mission is to 1) promote current and former students, staff, faculty, and the department as a whole, 2) organize professional development events for students and postdocs, 3) establish travel awards and outreach activities, and 4) facilitate diversity, equity, inclusion, and respect (DEIR).
